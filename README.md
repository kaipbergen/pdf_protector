PDF Protector
PDF Protector is a Python application designed to secure your PDF documents with password protection. Built with a user-friendly graphical interface using Tkinter, it allows for easy encryption of PDFs to keep your sensitive information safe. The application also features image buttons for a clean, intuitive experience.

How It Works
Upon launching, PDF Protector presents a straightforward interface where users can:

Select the PDF file to be protected (Source PDF File).
Specify the output location and name for the encrypted PDF (Target PDF File).
Set the desired password for encryption (Set User Password).
With just a few clicks, any PDF can be encrypted with a user-provided password.

Features

Visuals
The application uses custom images for buttons to enhance the user experience.
